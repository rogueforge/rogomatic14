building:

 - should build and compile


code bugs:

 - inventory/pack messages are shortened and should not be
   wrapping around and clobbering the 2nd line of the display.


strange happenings:

 - pack looks like it is being corrupted
 - invalid inferences
   - changed rogue5.4.4 to get around this, i really 
     didn't want to redo the database/inference code
 - direction: (messages, problems with something)
 - when an item is stolen (troubles)
 - running around without armor on
 - fighting a close up monster with another 
   behind it at a distance (switches between
   thrower and hitter but doesn't look like
   it actually accomplishes anything and then
   gets killed)
 - doesn't find some passageways when searching
 - tries to go down when not on stairway
 - doesn't use detect scrolls/potions
 - drops and picks up useless items
 - will starve to death standing on a
   scare monster scroll
 - forgets useful information about pack items


screen not updating correctly:

 - leftover '.', '@' and other characters in dark rooms
 - passages are sometimes blank instead of '#'
 - monster letters don't get removed
 - #'s get put to the left


someday:

 - test against different versions of rogue than 5.4.4.

for rogue5.4.4:

 - verify basic 5.4.4 rogue build
 - fix two messages (grammar)
 - change colors so they aren't the same (fixes 
   invalid inference/reference problem)
 - update autotools, etc.
