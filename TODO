building:

 - should build and compile


code bugs:

 - should now recognize the "an +0,0 arrow" message.

 - when the nymph steals something the message is now
   handled correctly.


strange happenings:

 - invalid inferences
   - changed rogue5.4.4 to get around this, i really 
     didn't want to redo the database/inference code
 - direction: (messages, problems with something)
 - running around without armor on
 - fighting a close up monster with another 
   behind it at a distance (switches between
   thrower and hitter but doesn't look like
   it actually accomplishes anything and then
   gets killed)
 - doesn't find some passageways when searching
 - tries to go down when not on stairway
 - doesn't use detect scrolls/potions
 - drops and picks up useless items
 - will starve to death standing on a
   scare monster scroll
 - forgets useful information about pack items


screen not updating correctly:

 - leftover '.', '@' and other characters in dark rooms
 - passages are sometimes blank instead of '#'
 - monster letters don't get removed
 - #'s get put to the left


someday:

 - test against different versions of rogue than 5.4.4.

for rogue5.4.4:


  [these are done]

 - verify basic 5.4.4 rogue build
 - fix two messages (grammar)
 - fix spelling of missle to missile
 - change colors so they aren't the same (fixes 
   invalid inference/reference problem),
   gold -> golden, silver -> silvery


  [this one still needs to be done]

 - update autotools, etc.
