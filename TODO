===== rogomatic

building:

 - should build and compile


code bugs/changes:

 - fixing some more ambiguous messages with this version:

   - before rogue would give the same message for the result
     from reading three different scrolls if nothing happened:

     "you feel a strange sense of loss"

     now that is only retained for hold monster

     protect armor now returns "your scalp itches", enchant 
     armor returns "your arms tingle", and enchant weapon 
     "your hands tingle"

   - for potions two of them returned the same messages from 
     rogue:

     "you have a %s feeling for a moment, then it passes"
        choose_str("normal", "strange"))

     this message is retained for detect monsters

     the messages for the detect magic potion were changed to:

     "you daydream of %s for a moment, then it passes"
       choose_str("sunshine", "finding the amulet"))

 - with the fix of the octal 310 character coming from
   rogue that should take care of any remaining issues
   with the nymph taking items from the pack.  

   but note that when the nymph now hits she takes all of an 
   item if there are more than one...


strange happenings:

 - still problems with cursed items (if you weild a weapon
   and your existing weapon is cursed and the letter of the
   new weapon is "q" then you will be told that you are
   quaffing something?  similar problem if weapon is letter
   "d" then dropping something?), etc.
 - direction: (might be related to cursed item)
 - running around without armor on
 - fighting a close up monster with another 
   behind it at a distance (switches between
   thrower and hitter but doesn't look like
   it actually accomplishes much of anything 
   and then gets killed)
 - doesn't find some passageways when searching
 - tries to go down when not on stairway
 - doesn't use detect scrolls/potions
 - repeatedly drops and picks up useless items
 - will starve to death standing on a
   scare monster scroll
 - forgets useful information about pack items


screen not updating correctly:

 - leftover '.', '@' and other characters in dark rooms
 - passages are sometimes blank instead of '#'
 - monster letters don't get removed
 - #'s get put to the left


someday:

 - test against different versions of rogue 
   other than 5.4.4.


===== rogue


rogue 5.4.4 ant 1.0.3 (this is the version i use 
for testing rogomatic):

  [these are done]

 - configuration changes
 - fix several messages (grammar)
 - fix spelling of missle to missile
 - change colors so they aren't the same (fixes 
   invalid inference/reference problem),
   gold -> golden, silver -> silvery
 - change even more messages from potions and
   scrolls to eliminate other invalid inference/
   reference problems
 - fix the bug from when the nymph stole an item,
   it was an invalid reference to a freed space
   that caused rogue to return an octal 310.  the
   nymph now steals all of an item if she hits and
   there is more than one of them


rogue 5.4.4 rgm (version for the purists):

 - configuration fixes
 - fix for the nymph steals item bug


No bugs known for rogue 5.4.4 rgm or rogue 5.4.4 ant 1.0.3
