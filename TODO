===== rogomatic


building:

 - should build and compile

 - i have a report of this not working on a 64 
   bit system, but details are still unknown.


code bugs/changes:


    [r1.0.8]
  - command.c, bumped up limits so that errors that were
    previously considered fatal have enough time to finish.


    [r1.0.7]
  - changed configure.ac to fix configure error about
    missing "missing" script.

  - rooms.c currentrectangle was setting negative values
    added checks to make sure that doesn't happen again.

  - things.c wield weapon handling doesn't work quite right,
    fixed bug in sendcnow, but then just commented the call
    out for now as it wasn't doing what i expected.  will 
    continue researching this for the next release.


    [r1.0.6]
  - io.c scrolling caused problems, one bug fixed, but another
    still remains to be solved.

  - rooms.c fixed a debugging use of (v,h) to now use directional
    letters (u,d,l,r) instead, makes things a little clearer.

  - explore.c fixed small bug in debugging info display during
    monster avoiding.

  - command.c bumped up limits for error reporting.

  - got rid of deciphervt100.c and adjusted src/Makefile.am.


    [r1.0.5]
  - fixed my mistake in last change.  it would not have 
    worked well.
 

    [r1.0.4]
  - working on fixing the "1y" direction infinite loop bug
    (repeatedly tries to walk into a wall).  the quick
    fix is in this version.  this way at least there won't 
    be an infinite loop, instead rogomatic will give a 
    fatal error message and then quit.  the actual figuring 
    out of why and correcting it will take a different 
    release (i'm looking into it now as i get time).


    [r1.0.3]
  - reformatted code.  enough reading of strange indents
    already...  no other changes than reformatting.


    [r1.0.2]
  - wielding weapons can fail mid-weild causing troubles.
    fixed so that there is more and better checking of
    weapon traits -- this seems to eliminate several other
    bugs/error messages that were happening.


strange happenings:

 - weapon handling oddities
   - throwing arrows without wielding the bow
 - running around without armor on
 - fighting a close up monster with another 
   behind it at a distance (switches between
   thrower and hitter but doesn't look like
   it actually accomplishes much of anything 
   and then gets killed)
 - more loop when next to an Aquator and an
   Ice Monster
 - doesn't find some passageways when searching
 - tries to go down when not on stairway
 - doesn't use detect scrolls/potions
 - repeatedly drops and picks up useless items
 - will starve to death standing on a
   scare monster scroll


wishlist items:

 - do the same sort of thing for armor
   handling that i did for weapon handling
 - fix the repeated display of a pack item,
   a cosmetic thing, but it's annoying to
   keep seeing that message...
 - fix configure/automake stuff to work with
   ncurses debugging includes and libraries


screen not updating correctly:

 - leftover '.', '@' and other characters in dark rooms
 - passages are sometimes blank instead of '#'
 - monster letters don't get removed
 - #'s get put to the left
 - the internal representation of the screen is correct
   so these are what seems to be cosmetic flaws.


rogue and rog-o-matic versions someday:

 - test against different versions of rogue 
   other than my 5.4.4. altered version.

   - yes, finally did some of this and it looks like
     making changes for the bsdgames-nonfree version of
     rogue is too large.  skip this...

   - the rogue fork versions at coredumpcentral.org seem
     to actually work somewhat, but i don't think any of
     them get very far...



===== rogue


No bugs known for rogue5.4.4-rgm-r1.0.2 or rogue5.4.4-ant-r1.0.8


rogue5.4.4-ant-r1.0.8 (this is the version i use 
for testing rogomatic):

  [these are done]

 - configuration changes
 - fix several messages (grammar)
 - fix spelling of missle to missile
 - change colors so they aren't the same (fixes 
   invalid inference/reference problem in 
   rogomatic), gold -> golden, silver -> silvery
 - change even more messages from potions and
   scrolls to eliminate other invalid inference/
   reference problems in rogomatic
 - fix the bug from when the nymph stole an item,
   it was an invalid reference to a freed space
   that caused rogue to return an octal 310.  the
   nymph now steals all of an item if she hits and
   there is more than one of them
 - make the environment variable SEED useful for 
   testing (repeatable random number sequences)
 - when changing levels make sure to drop down
   on a space that is not occupied
 - fix invalid reference to freed space
 - cleaned up a few memory leftovers reported by
   valgrind memcheck
 - fixed maze/room generation bug that was causing
   an infinite loop


rogue5.4.4-rgm-r1.0.2 (version for the purists):

 - configuration fixes
 - fix for the nymph steals item bug
 - fix reference to freed space
