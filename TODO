===== rogomatic

building:

 - should build and compile


code bugs/changes:

    [r1.0.4]
  - working on fixing the "1y" direction infinite loop bug
    (repeatedly tries to walk into a wall).  the quick
    fix is in this version.  this way at least there won't 
    be an infinite loop, instead rogomatic will give a 
    fatal error message and then quit.  the actual figuring 
    out of why and correcting it will take a different 
    release (i'm looking into it now as i get time).

    [r1.0.3]
  - reformatted code.  enough reading of strange indents
    already...  no other changes than reformatting.

    [r1.0.2]
  - wielding weapons can fail mid-weild causing troubles.
    fixed so that there is more and better checking of
    weapon traits -- this seems to eliminate several other
    bugs/error messages that were happening.


strange happenings:

 - running around without armor on
 - fighting a close up monster with another 
   behind it at a distance (switches between
   thrower and hitter but doesn't look like
   it actually accomplishes much of anything 
   and then gets killed)
 - more loop when next to an Aquator and an
   Ice Monster
 - doesn't find some passageways when searching
 - tries to go down when not on stairway
 - doesn't use detect scrolls/potions
 - repeatedly drops and picks up useless items
 - will starve to death standing on a
   scare monster scroll

wishlist items:
 - do the same sort of thing for armor
   handling that i did for weapon handling
 - fix the repeated display of a pack item,
   a cosmetic thing, but it's annoying to
   keep seeing that message...

screen not updating correctly:

 - leftover '.', '@' and other characters in dark rooms
 - passages are sometimes blank instead of '#'
 - monster letters don't get removed
 - #'s get put to the left
 - the internal representation of the screen is correct
   so this is a cosmetic bug


rogue rog-o-matic versions someday:

 - test against different versions of rogue 
   other than 5.4.4.


===== rogue


rogue5.4.4-ant-r1.0.7 (this is the version i use 
for testing rogomatic):

  [these are done]

 - configuration changes
 - fix several messages (grammar)
 - fix spelling of missle to missile
 - change colors so they aren't the same (fixes 
   invalid inference/reference problem in 
   rogomatic), gold -> golden, silver -> silvery
 - change even more messages from potions and
   scrolls to eliminate other invalid inference/
   reference problems in rogomatic
 - fix the bug from when the nymph stole an item,
   it was an invalid reference to a freed space
   that caused rogue to return an octal 310.  the
   nymph now steals all of an item if she hits and
   there is more than one of them
 - make the environment variable SEED useful for 
   testing (repeatable random number sequences)
 - when changing levels make sure to drop down
   on a space that is not occupied
 - fix invalid reference to freed space
 - cleaned up a few memory leftovers reported by
   valgrind memcheck


rogue5.4.4-rgm (version for the purists):

 - configuration fixes
 - fix for the nymph steals item bug
 - fix reference to freed space


No bugs known for rogue5.4.4-rgm or rogue5.4.4-ant-r1.0.7
