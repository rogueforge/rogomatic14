    Allow local rlog directory to override the value of the RGMDIR and LOCKFILE
    # defines.  This allows me to do development easier.

Date:   Wed May 7 18:33:31 2008 +0000

    Added lots of ignore properties, as well as moved some files around.

    This should install and run now (at least in my home directory), still need
    to try on a multi-user setup.

    A few more fixes.

Date:   Wed Apr 30 06:54:35 2008 +0000

    Big changes
      - added new copyrights to all files
      - moved things which are sort of developer docs or historical info to doc
        directory (will find a better place later on)
      - removed files which I can't figure out what to do with (for instance there
        seem to be various animation files for which the creating programs are
        missing, so just deleting them for now, will probably rip out that stuff
        anyway and instead have some sort of splash screen?).

    Moving things out of the way in order to get framewerk working.

    This will now compile and work under MacOSX if you have the patched rogue36

Date:   Fri Apr 25 06:12:28 2008 +0000

    Initial import of the code from http://robot-club.com/lti/rgm14.tar.Z
    
    I also found 3 versions of the code at
    http://www.roguelikedevelopment.org/archive/index.php
    but the version above seemed the most recent.
